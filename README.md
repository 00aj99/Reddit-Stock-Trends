## Usage

#### Reddit API
- Get your reddit API credentials from [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
- Follow [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/scraping-reddit-with-praw-76efc1d1e1d9) article to get your credentials.

#### Running Scripts
- Go to `src/` directory.
- Create a `praw.ini` file with the following
```
[ClientSecrets]
client_id=<your client id>
client_secret=<your client secret>
user_agent=<your user agent>
```
Note that the title of this section, `ClientSecrets`, is important because `ticker_counts.py` will specifically look for that title in the `praw.ini` file.
- Install required modules using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `ticker_count.py` first
- Now run `yfinance_analysis.py`
- You will be able to find your results in `data/` directory.

- [ ] Add visualisations
- [ ] Add time series to figure out at what time did stock trend and what time did posts/comments on reddit spike
- [ ] Scrape comments as well
- [ ] NLP implementation for SA
- [ ] Create a scoring model that takes into account upvotes/comments/awards and mentions

Suggestions are appreciated.
