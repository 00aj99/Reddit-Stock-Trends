### To Do
- [x] Turn it into python executable rather than notebook
- [ ] Turn this into a local module that can be used in notebooks/python scripts
- [ ] Scrape catalysts from DDs
- [ ] Add visualisations 
- [ ] Add time series to figure out at what time did stock trend and what time did posts/comments on reddit spike
- [ ] Scrape comments as well
- [ ] NLP implementation for SA
- [ ] Create a scoring model that takes into account upvotes/comments/awards and mentions

Suggestions are appreciated.
